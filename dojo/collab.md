Geekdojo aspires to educate audiences on new technology and trends through direct application. Said another way, we love to create an exciting project around a new technology. Those projects are typically, but not always, focused on the home environment including home automation, gaming, streaming, home networking, home audio, and many other categories. We utilize a number of media platforms to convey project content and tie everything together with content on Geekdojo's main website. If you feel your brand or product might be a good fit for Geekdojo's audiences please reach out via email to [collab@geekdojo.com](mailto:collab@geekdojo.com?subject=Brand Collaboration).
